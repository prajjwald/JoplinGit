- [x] resource deletion with multiple notebooks should avoid false positives ... Prune all from root (might already be doing, need to sanity check)
- [x] pull out settings into separate file
- [x] commits with messages (-m option)
- [ ] path prefix option - might be transient move to subfolder, then move back, will probably need exception handling
- [ ] notebook prefix option to avoid local notebook name collision - need to think more about this, as names might get hard to manage
